OK, so the core of this is...

    Lose the formatter idea, something instead just needs to
    own/instantiate/whatever a T object, then it needs to
    load the features, all that jazz, and pass through the
    t object







Loading phase:
    Load the feature files, giving back a feature model
    Instatiate a step definition loader and matcher

Running the tests:
    Instatiate a step dispatcher, which requires

    Step dispatcher requires:
        + The feature model
        + A step matcher
        + A step execution environment

        It instantiates a Test Status object

        Then for each feature, scenario, step
            Get the step from the step matcher
            StepExecutor->execute( StepCode, TestStatusObject, StepModel )
            Dispatch the result to the formatter

            Execute the step with the Test Status Object, and Step Execution Environment
